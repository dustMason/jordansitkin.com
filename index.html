        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        
        <p>
          <p>
            Making software is a creative pursuit. Before I discovered my love for
            writing code, I considered myself a designer.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Beyond instructions in files, good code is about clear communication
            between people. An experienced engineer considers the landscape
            around the problem while crafting a solution. Good solutions not
            only satisfy requirements but resist complexity, favoring concision
            and clarity.

          <h4>Senior Developer</h4>
          <h5>From 2015 in Oakland, CA</h5>
          
          <p>
            My grandparents started Kit Kraft in Studio City in 1946, and my father
            took over running the store when I was a kid. In 2015 I decided to join
            the family and help turn around a downward sales trend on the
            then-aging website.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I designed and developed a new site, migrating from an off-the-shelf
            PHP framework (X-Cart) to a custom Rails project. Since launch, nearly
            every aspect of the business has benefited. Together with the team in
            Los Angeles I helped integrate a new point of sale system and modernize
            outdated purchasing and inventory systems. Site revenue has increased
            28%.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Technical Highlights</h5>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Docker + Amazon ECS on AWS create a painless development and deployment
              story. New team members can spin up a local dev stack with a single
              command.
            </li>
            <li>
              A new custom fulfillment backend helps get orders out quickly and
              correctly. Integrations with our shipping providers handle postage
              and labels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Custom marketing tools help our team get the data they need and make
              changes to site content without developer involvement.
            </li>
            <li>
              System design embraces AWS services to lower operational overhead.
              We utilize EC2, ECS &amp; ECR, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch, RDS,
              ElastiCache, Lambda, SQS, Route 53 and SES across two regions.
            </li>

          <h4>Tech Nut</h4>
          <h5>2014-2015 in Oakland, CA</h5>
          
          <p>
            I joined nuts.com during a period of rapid growth, and on my first day
            started work on a brand new front end for the site. My responsibilities
            were wide ranging. I led efforts to refine UX, extend the brand's
            visual identity and establish design standards. I also designed and 
            implemented a modern responsive front end codebase based on logicless
            templates and discrete components.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Highlights</h5>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created a library of composable AMD modules to power the front end.
              There are few dependencies, and no heavy front end frameworks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented all site templates in mustache, moving display logic
              into a separate view layer. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Planned, designed and illustrated visual assets â€“ everything from
              vinyl wraps for delivery trucks to packaging concepts to site promos.
            </li>
            <li>
              Helped move a brittle deployment flow based on Chef/OpsWorks to a
              more robust one based on Docker and Amazon ECS.

          <p>
            The OP-1 is a tiny synthesizer with a unique workflow and a dedicated
            following (myself among them). I wanted to create some special tools
            and share them with the community.

            <li>
              Deployed ffmpeg on AWS Lambda to perform operations on audio files.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented a REST API modeled after the JSON API spec to allow
              external companion apps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented direct uploads to S3 and file processing on Lambda to
              keep server load down. The lambda functions use the site's API to
              persist their results.
            </li>
            <li>
              The site handles user interaction via the web MIDI API to allow
              live patch previews right on the site.
